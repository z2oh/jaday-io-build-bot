# jaday-io-build-bot
I used to host a bot to build my personal website on a raspberry pi and deploy it to GitHub pages. These were some helper scripts that I used to make this happen. This project was abandoned because [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) is free and is much more stable than a raspberry pi 2 under my desk haphazardly plugged in to my router.
